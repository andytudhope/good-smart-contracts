# Good Smart Contracts

An opinionated collection of interesting smart contract examples that I gather as I wander around learning more about distributed networks, consensus, and how to work productively with these new technologies.

Feel free to poke around, put in suggestions for excellent contracts you find and we might even be able to build something of a reference library for how to do things the right way.

If you're looking for the bare-bones, basic stuff, also take a peak [here](https://github.com/fivedogit/solidity-baby-steps) and [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14EIe984_86Y-uuNm-a4EsVeD3eI4qAAlz_MZof1qkqM/edit).
